# Abomination Vaults

This adventure path happens in Otari, the same region as the adventures "Menace under Otari", so it's also an option to carry your characters straight forward, even though they'd start at level 2 instead of level 1. Be warned though, the Abomination Vaults has a darker setting that comes with a content warning. I can adjust things and remove triggering and problematic parts that you don't want to appear in an adventure, but make sure to let me know in time so I can adjust it appropriately in a way that still fits the story and setting.

> [!warning] Content Warning
> While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism, body horror, and human experimentation. Before you begin, understand that player consent (including that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.

The Abomination Vaults is a full on adventure path with a lot of content (levels 1 to 11) and extensive setting, lore, high quality maps and amazing ambience from what I've seen so far. It doesn't include pregenerated characters, so really go wild with your characters. Or if you're not comfortable and want something a little simpler, just continue with one of the pregenerated characters from [[TTRPGs/Menace Under Otari\|Menace Under Otari]] or maybe [[TTRPGs/Abomination Vaults#Little Troubles in Big Absalom\|#Little Troubles in Big Absalom]] since those would be adequate levels as well.

Official adventure paths always include a player's guide that gives you a spoiler free overview over:

- Some small bits of the settings and the backgrounds of why you're doing the adventure.
- Recommendations for alignments, ancestries, classes, languages, and skills that make good choices for the adventure path.
- New unique backgrounds or archetypes specifically made for the adventure.
- A gazzetter with useful information about the area that's good to know.
- Other additional information depending on the adventure path.

That said here is a short excerpt of the setting:

> [!abstract] Setting overview
> When the mysterious lighthouse called Gauntlight glows with baleful light, the people of Otari suspect that itâ€™s an ominous prelude to sinister events. Heroes must explore the ruins around the lighthouse and delve into the dungeon levels below. Hideous monsters, deadly traps, and vengeful ghosts all await the heroes who dare to enter the sprawling megadungeon called the Abomination Vaults!

This adventure has an official integration with FoundryVTT that is done in really high quality.
