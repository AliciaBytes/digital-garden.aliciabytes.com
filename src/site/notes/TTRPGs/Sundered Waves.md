# Sundered Waves

This adventure is designed for a party of level 5 characters. What treasure did your old captain leave behind and how will old pirate crew mates that don't necessarily get along as well and each want their "fair" share of treasure challenge the adventure. You'll have to wait and see what treasure awaits.

> [!abstract] Setting
> Five years ago, many regarded the Brass Bird as a fearsome pirate ship that sailed the waters as far north as Varisia and as far south as the Shackles. Captain Renlock recruited a capable crew and though they were relentless in their pursuit of treasure, they rendered mercy upon those they captured—often releasing prisoners to leave aboard relatively undamaged vessels. Still, Captain Renlock’s piracy drew the attention of numerous navies and privateers in Avistan and Garund. When a pirate hunter from the Andoran fleet finally caught up to the Brass Bird, Captain Renlock cut a deal to spare his crew, turning over his ship and himself to commute many of his crew members’ sentences.
> 
> Renlock spent the last few years of his life in prison, keeping his trusty clockwork parrot, Cawlo, close by his side. His crew scattered to the wind. Some members of the Brass Bird served time in jail for other crimes, but most were released after only a few months.
> 
> When Renlock passed from illness, his clanking, clattering parrot took flight to complete one final task. Seeking out four members of the Brass Bird’s crew, Cawlo gave each a fragment of a map with a message on the back. The parrot promised the crew members that they would find a hidden treasure if they arrived at the final resting site of the Brass Bird by dawn after the next full moon.
