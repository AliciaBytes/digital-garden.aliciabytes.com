# Otari - Player's Guide

This is a spoiler-free description and guide to Otari. The contents here are considered common knowledge among Otari's citizens and your characters can build of this setting. It's possible for your heroes to hail from Otari, but this is not necessary, as long as they are in the town for some reason.

The heroes might or might not know each other at the start of the campaign, but everyone should have some kind of connection in Otari that leads them to mission from Tamily Tanderveil at the local fishery.

## Otari Gazetteer

Otari is a thriving, diverse lumber town and trade port with a storied past and its fair share of sinister secrets. Founded by a group of adventurers over 400 years ago, the town has weathered attacks from kobolds and strange monsters, economic woes and windfalls, and cycles of prosperity and strife. Today, the town is a prosperous community and one of the largest settlements along the island’s southern coast.

Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two looming cliffs. The Osprey River flows into the sea through the middle of this valley, and the sturdy stone to either side of this river supports hundreds of buildings and a deep harbor. Otari rarely floods, but the numerous caves, warrens, and channels dug beneath the town do so regularly.

Though day-to-day life in Otari resembles that in any small town, its skyline stands out due to the enormous waterwheel at its eastern edge, the ingenious and enormous flume that brings lumber down the cliffside for easy transportation, and a stunning domed temple to Sarenrae to the west. The town’s location near a major highway and its long history as a home to various adventuring parties draw many visitors. Lively trade passing through means unusual wares (and even magic items) aren’t too difficult to find.

Just over 1,200 people live in Otari. While most of its residents are humans, some dwarves, elves, and other ancestries also live here. The majority of its residents work in the local fishing and lumber industries. For the most part, people in Otari are friendly and welcoming, though they prefer its small-town feel and make lighthearted fun of visitors from big cities. Coffee is a mainstay, a favorite drink among the hardworking and early-rising townsfolk.

Oseph Menhemes, a descendant of one of Otari’s founders, has served multiple terms as the town’s elected mayor thanks to his easygoing efficiency and the townspeople’s general deference to tradition. He also runs one of the town’s main lumber companies, making him wealthy as well as influential.

## Who's who in Otari

### Lardus Longsaddle

The Otari Guard keeps the peace in town, and their leader is the gruff and stout Captain Lardus Longsaddle. Any heroes who get in trouble with the Otari Guard should hope to deal with anyone other than the captain—his curse-laden tirades are legendary, and he’s inclined to issue short jail sentences for minor infractions. Conversely, heroes who catch criminals earn a rare (though often short-lived) position on Captain Longsaddle’s good side.

### Oseph Menhemes

The current mayor of Otari is Oseph Menhemes, patriarch of one of three local lumber companies and owner of Otari’s massive Giant’s Wheel and Loading Flume. Though dedicated to his role as a public servant and a devoted family man with many children, Oseph is ambitious and wants to expand the town’s lumber-processing capacities.

### Vandy Banderdash

The head priestess of Otari’s largest temple, the Dawnflower Library, is a chatty woman named Vandy Banderdash. Always eager to greet newcomers, regardless of their faith or vocation, Vandy has a surprising knack for recommending the perfect bit of reading to people she has only just met. Though open-minded on almost every subject, she has no patience for thievery, as her sister stole several valuable books from the temple and fled not long ago.

### Yinyasmera

The shrewd Yinyasmera owns Crook’s Nook, making her one of the town’s most prominent business owners. The fact that she’s also the head of the Osprey Club, Otari’s thieves’ guild, only increases her influence. She’s loyal to her town and rarely permits her thieves to target locals, although outsiders are fair targets for con games or robberies. Heroes unafraid to step outside the law eventually come to Yinyasmera’s attention.

## Places in Otari

### Crow’s Cask

A sign over the door to this two-story stone building depicts a group of drunk crows perched on a leaky cask. Crow’s Casks is more than just a tavern — it’s a brewery and a shrine to Cayden Cailean, the god of heroes, bravery, and ale. Its proprietor, Magiloy, is a retired pirate who enjoys experimenting with new drinks. She’s always looking for enthusiastic customers to taste her latest concoctions.

This brewery’s proprietor, Magiloy, creates magical potions in addition to delicious (but sometimes questionable) beverages — your GM will have information about what sorts of potions and dubious drinks might be for sale during any one visit. Magiloy might reserve special potions or good deals for those who fetch rare ingredients for her or for those who break up the tavern’s occasional bar fights.

### Crook’s Nook

Crook’s Nook serves several purposes in town—the large wooden structure functions as a bridge over the Osprey River, as a cheap place to get a room for the night, and as a tavern well known for serving the best seafood in town. Trapdoors in the tavern’s floor allow direct access to the river below for fishing, and foolhardy (or inebriated) patrons sometimes wrestle over these openings to determine who’s stronger and who’s getting wet. The building’s attic serves as the guildhall for Otari’s thieves’ guild, the Osprey Club—a function that’s perhaps the town’s worst-kept secret, as evidenced by the building’s very name.

### Otari Fishery

Every night, from an hour before sundown to an hour before midnight, Tamily Tanderveil opens the ground floor of the town’s main fishery to sailors, laborers, and travelers alike, offering a comfortable and welcoming place to gather for games and entertainment. A small menu is offered for those who wish to have drinks or snacks while gaming here, the proceeds of which Tamily frequently gives back in the form of contests and prize money for various impromptu gaming tournaments.

### Otari Garrison

The headquarters of the Otari Guard is a sturdy stone building hung with green-and-white banners that match the guards’ uniforms. These guards keep the peace in town and patrol the surrounding roads to ensure they stay free of banditry and trouble. They also serve as the town’s firefighters.

### Rowdy Rockfish

Despite its name, the Rowdy Rockfish is the quietest and quaintest of Otari’s taverns. A sign depicting a rockfish with its fins up in a boxing pose hangs outside, but within, the calm demeanor of the tavern’s patrons might make someone wonder if it’s the only tavern in the Inner Sea to never host a barroom brawl. The Rockfish’s current proprietor is a dignified dwarf named Brelda Venkervale, a stoic businesswoman who took over the bar after her son, Lasda—the previous owner—vanished without a trace. She still seeks out information about her missing son, certain that he still lives.

### Dawnflower Library

Otari’s largest temple is built at the town’s westernmost edge, atop an upraised shelf that’s nevertheless far below the clifftop. The library’s position allows it to catch the rays of the rising sun, which transform its central dome into a glowing testament to the sun goddess Sarenrae—at least when the sky is clear. While principally dedicated to Sarenrae, the Dawnflower Library welcomes all non-evil faiths. The building’s two wings each contain shrines, and the center houses a wide range of books, including histories, satires, textbooks, and maps to innumerable exciting locales.

Otari’s largest temple contains more than ordinary books; the clerics also sell scrolls, wands, and magic weapons. True to her reputation of being unusually knowledgeable, the high priestess Vandy Banderdash can often direct visitors to exactly the scroll or weapon they need.

### Stone Ring Pond

A total of two dozen standing stones, each exactly 12 feet high, stand like sentries around the shores of a shallow pond. The site is usually occupied by polite but aloof pilgrims of Desna (patron of travelers) or of Gozreh (patron of nature). A kindly nature priest named Worliwynn permanently resides there, and she helps the loggers work harmoniously with nature.

### Blades for Glades

The primary smithy in town specializes in crafting saws, axes, and other tools used in the lumber trade, but the skilled smiths here also produce quality armor, shields, and weapons. The owner of Blades for Glades is a misanthropic man named Carman Rajani, who’s as happy to sell a sword to split a monster as a hatchet to fell a tree. He’s descended from one of Otari’s founders and believes himself entitled to better treatment from the townspeople than his surly demeanor earns him.

### Gallentine Deliveries

Oloria Gallentine is a seventh-generation citizen of Otari and the owner of the fastest and most reliable delivery service in the area. Oloria can probably acquire anything the heroes need that they can’t find in Otari, although the price for such orders might be steep.

### Odd Stories

The wizard Morlibint specializes in fanciful fiction, but he and his husband also sell textbooks, teaching tools, and scrolls. Morlibint is incredibly wellread and can help the heroes decipher tomes in ancient or unusual languages they might encounter in their adventures. He eagerly purchases rare books the heroes come across in their adventures, hoping to resell them at a profit (after reading them, of course).

### Otari Market

Part open-air farmer’s market, part log-cabin trading post, the Otari Market is a one-stop shop for basic goods. Available wares include all adventuring gear, light armor, and simple weapons. The market’s owner is the dour, humorless Keeleno Lathenar. Keeleno pays handsomely for wolf pelts, as a wolf-like monster slew his wife years ago, and he hopes to one day acquire the skin of her killer.

### Wrin’s Wonders

This odd, domed building is always open. The proprietor, Wrin Sivinxi, sells adventuring gear and magic items. Wrin is a bit unusual, seeing menace in every corner and truths in the constellations above, but she’s eager to get to know adventurers and show off the many magical trinkets in her collection.

## Ancestries

For being a small town, Otari has an exceptionally open-minded view of people from elsewhere. In part, this attitude is due to the town’s proximity to the cosmopolitan metropolis of Absalom, only a few days’ travel away. Townspeople in Otari might consider other people strange — certainly, Wrin Sivinxi is considered a good-natured eccentric by most — but that’s due to personal behavior, not ancestry. In short, no matter what ancestry you choose, you won't stick out too much in this Town.

Running errands for Keeleno around town, you've gotten to know him almost as well as you know Otari. Keeleno's suspicions have rubbed off on you a bit, so you keep a wary eye on other people— particularly around the full moon.

You've looked through some of the smaller ruins in the Otari hinterlands but have never quite built up the courage to check out the creepy lighthouse called Gauntlight.

You know that Wrin has paralyzing claustrophobia; she sees menace in angles and danger in confined spaces, which is why her shop is an all domed canvas that opens to the sky.
