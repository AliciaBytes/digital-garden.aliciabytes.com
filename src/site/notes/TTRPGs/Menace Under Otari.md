# Menace Under Otari

## Content Warning

> [!warning] Content Warning - Arachnophobia
> Menace under Otari includes spiders, let me know if this is an issue and I'll replace them with something else.

## Setting

> [!abstract] Setting
> The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors, but above all, it’s a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights. Such adventure always seemed so distant—until today!
> 
> Word has begun to spread around Otari that there’s a problem down at the Otari Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry enough to eat the fishers next!
> 
> You’ve received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the Fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help. With the town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse and put an end to the beast that’s feasting on her fish! Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?

> [!info] Additional Setting Information
> The adventure will take place in Otari, but your character doesn't necessarily have to be from Otari, we can find other ties to the city and why your character is looking for adventure there. I can provide further background and information on the town upon request and you will learn more about it at the start of the game anyways.
