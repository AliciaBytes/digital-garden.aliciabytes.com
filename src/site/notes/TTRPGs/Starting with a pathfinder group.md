# Start with Patfhinder 2e

Pathfinder 2e build on the same roots as D&D and indeed 1st edition is relatively similar to D&D 3.5e. Pathfinder 2e diverges a bit with a lot of modernizations and mechanic changes, so it needs some adjustment coming from D&D, PF 1e or other roleplaying games.

I quite like the flexibility of the setting and ideas behind the changes so far. It also allows an easier time with non-standard more unorthodox party constellation which don't work as well in other TTRPGs, for example a combat healer is nice to have, but far from necessary if nobody wants to play it. You should at least bring some out of combat healing though as it is heavily recommended to maybe necessary depending on campaign and party, it has more options for out of combat healing though which basically allows every single class to at least get a little bit, so shouldn't be hard to get at least something in the party.

It also has the advantage of having all the rules content online for free and officially sanctioned, so it allows a lot of flexibility right of the bat while I don't have all the rule books. They make money with the books being a bit more organized and nicely laid out as well as the official lore books only being available for purchase and not part of the official free online content, see the section [Free online rules](#free-online-rules) below.

I would use an online tool ([Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com)) for playing, so we don't have to physically be next to each other and also to reduce the required resources (handmade/printed maps, physical dice, **miniatures**, etc.). Since there is some official Pathfinder content available for it (beginner box and abomination vaults), some of the adventure choices could be really high professional quality.

Feel free to talk to me or ask me about pathfinder or anything written here if you'd like to know more.

## Entry adventure

There is a recommended adventure with the Beginner's Box that nicely introduces players and the GM to the gameplay and rules, I'd love to start with this first and then go from there. It's supposed to be about 12 hours of gameplay across multiple sessions covering level 1 & 2 to get a common starting ground.

It includes 4 pregenerated characters for the party, but I don't want to limit choices to those. I'll tell you when a character doesn't fit at all and you shoul'd maybe choose something else, but for the most part just let your mind run free and go forwhat you want, I want to leave a lot of flexibility. All the character options are free online and officially sanctioned online, see [#Free online rules](#free-online-rules).

> [!abstract] Setting
> The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors, but above all, it’s a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights. Such adventure always seemed so distant—until today!
> 
> Word has begun to spread around Otari that there’s a problem down at the Otari Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry enough to eat the fishers next!
> 
> You’ve received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the Fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help. With the town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse and put an end to the beast that’s feasting on her fish! Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?

> [!info] Info
> The adventure will take place in Otari, but your character doesn't necessarily have to originally be from Otari, we can find other ties to the city and why your character is looking for adventure there. I can provide further background and information on the town upon request and you will learn more about it at the start of the game anyways.

After the beginner box I'd like to continue a while with some official content (although with some adjustments and homebrew to make it a bit more unique) before going for a completely custom adventure. There are several options for that by either:

- Adding some more quests onto the story of the beginner box.
- Playing 1 or 2 one shot adventures with different settings and tones.
- Going into the Abomination Vaults adventure path for a bit of a bigger adventure (designed for levels 1-11 and quite a bit more extensive). ***Warning: This adventure path has several content warnings.*** This one, like all official adventure paths also has a spoiler free players guide, and since it plays in the same area as the beginner box. See the section on it below for a link to the player's guide if you want to familiarize yourself with the area a bit more on your own before I share more lore. ***But be aware of the content warning for the adventure path, although the player guide shouldn't contain anything problematic, there might still be something in there***.
- Depending on things I might maybe get some other content as a choice, we'll see what's interesting.

## Possible follow up oneshots

These follow up one shots have a few different settings and are also designed for different levels. We can choose together which ones are most interesting if we want to continue with one of those. All the oneshots also come with pregenerated characters to choose from, but again you can create your own character that fits the setting.

Options that I'm considering are currently in increasing level of the oneshots:

### Little Troubles in Big Absalom

This adventure is designed for a party of level 1 characters and set in Absalom, the biggest city on Golarion and the center of the world with big historic relevance.

> [!abstract] Setting
> For generations, the Hookclaw kobolds have lived beneath the city known as Absalom, scratching out a hardscrabble existence by scavenging from the earthpacked ruins of ancient, buried buildings. In all that time, the Hookclaws have never been conquered or wiped out by more powerful forces, which makes them truly prestigious by kobold standards. Unfortunately, this prestige has never resulted in wealth or comfort. For as long as the Hookclaws have existed, they have lived in relative austerity among meager warrens and have simmered with envy at more famous and well-off kobold clans such as the renowned Sewer Dragons.
> 
> Yet the smell of change is in the air. Just recently, a party of Hookclaw miners accidentally broke into an underground room that was stuffed full of treasures and luxuries, most of them in far better condition than the time-rotted relics that the Hookclaws typically own. Firm advocates of looking gift horses in the mouth, however, the Hookclaws have rounded up their greatest heroes, most eager volunteers, and most violent misanthropes to explore the mysterious area. Once the chamber has been secured and deemed safe, the Hookclaws can cart off the treasure and live the opulent lives they have long deserved!

### A Fistful of Flowers

This adventure is designed for a party of level 3 characters. A rich noblewoman wanting to much and not caring about the ethics of keeping other living beings as decoration? What will you do to break out and regain your freedom?

> [!abstract] Setting
> The Verduran Forest is the largest woodland in Avistan. Despite the fact that it sprawls across some of the oldest and most powerful nations in the Inner Sea region, the druids, fey, and other residents of the wilderness have always resisted incursions from nearby civilizations. In nations like Andoran, this resistance has often led to violence, as Wildwood druids, protective fey, and local centaurs clash with exploitive logging companies. Yet not all relationships proved so antagonistic; in Taldor, the empire still holds to the Wildwood Treaty it signed in 3841 ar, which grants the forest legal protections and limits the amount of resources locals could take in any given year.
> 
> Of course, not every citizen respects the laws of their nations, and selfish or desperate individuals often attempt to skirt Taldor’s regulations. The latest of these infractions occurred when a Taldan noblewoman named Lady Constance Meliosa encountered a peculiar creature on one of her luxury camping expeditions — a tiny plant animated by a nature spirit, known as a leshy. Constance immediately fell in love with the creature and captured them, taking them to her manor to display to all her noble friends. Since the poor leshy couldn’t speak, the nobles interpreted their frantic attempts to escape as nothing more than adorable antics. To Lady Constance and her fellow aristocrats, the leshy was little more than a pet to be brought out on display.
> 
> It wouldn’t be long before Constance decided that a single leshy wasn’t enough — she needed more leshys to decorate her abode. Though she learned how to make her own leshys, the ones from Verduran Forest proved more popular with the local ladies, and so Constance made arrangements with a shady business contact. A week later, a crate of abducted, smuggled leshys arrived at the manor, and Constance set about arranging the imprisoned plants, unaware and uncaring that the forest had its own protectors.

### Sundered Waves

This adventure is designed for a party of level 5 characters. What treasure did your old captain leave behind and how will old pirate crew mates that don't necessarily get along as well and each want their "fair" share of treasure challenge the adventure. You'll have to wait and see what treasure awaits.

> [!abstract] Setting
> Five years ago, many regarded the Brass Bird as a fearsome pirate ship that sailed the waters as far north as Varisia and as far south as the Shackles. Captain Renlock recruited a capable crew and though they were relentless in their pursuit of treasure, they rendered mercy upon those they captured—often releasing prisoners to leave aboard relatively undamaged vessels. Still, Captain Renlock’s piracy drew the attention of numerous navies and privateers in Avistan and Garund. When a pirate hunter from the Andoran fleet finally caught up to the Brass Bird, Captain Renlock cut a deal to spare his crew, turning over his ship and himself to commute many of his crew members’ sentences.
> 
> Renlock spent the last few years of his life in prison, keeping his trusty clockwork parrot, Cawlo, close by his side. His crew scattered to the wind. Some members of the Brass Bird served time in jail for other crimes, but most were released after only a few months.
> 
> When Renlock passed from illness, his clanking, clattering parrot took flight to complete one final task. Seeking out four members of the Brass Bird’s crew, Cawlo gave each a fragment of a map with a message on the back. The parrot promised the crew members that they would find a hidden treasure if they arrived at the final resting site of the Brass Bird by dawn after the next full moon.

## Following up with the Abomination Vaults

This adventure path happens in the same region as the beginner box so it's also an option to carry your characters straight forward, even though they'd start at level 2 instead of level 1. Be warned though, the Abomination Vaults has a darker setting that comes with a content warning. I can adjust things and remove triggering and problematic parts that you don't want to appear in an adventure, but make sure to let me know in time so I can adjust it appropriately in a way that still fits the story and setting.

> [!warning] Content Warning
> While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism, body horror, and human experimentation. Before you begin, understand that player consent (including that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.

The Abomination Vaults is a full on adventure path with a lot of content (levels 1 to 11) and extensive setting, lore, high quality maps and amazing ambience from what I've seen so far. It doesn't include pregenerated characters, so really go wild with your characters. Or if you're not comfortable and want something a little simpler, just continue with one of the pregenerated characters from the beginners box or maybe [[TTRPGs/Starting with a pathfinder group#Little Troubles in Big Absalom\|#Little Troubles in Big Absalom]] since those would be adequate levels as well.

Official adventure paths always include a player's guide that gives you a spoiler free overview over:

- Some small bits of the settings and the backgrounds of why you're doing the adventure.
- Recommendations for alignments, ancestries, classes, languages, and skills that make good choices for the adventure path.
- New unique backgrounds or archetypes specifically made for the adventure.
- A gazzetter with useful information about the area that's good to know.
- Other additional information depending on the adventure path.

That said here is a short excerpt of the setting:

> [!abstract] Setting overview
> When the mysterious lighthouse called Gauntlight glows with baleful light, the people of Otari suspect that it’s an ominous prelude to sinister events. Heroes must explore the ruins around the lighthouse and delve into the dungeon levels below. Hideous monsters, deadly traps, and vengeful ghosts all await the heroes who dare to enter the sprawling megadungeon called the Abomination Vaults!
