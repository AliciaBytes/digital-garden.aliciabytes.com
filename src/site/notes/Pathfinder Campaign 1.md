# Pathfinder Campaign 1

I want this to be a friendly and welcoming campaign with no previous experience required. I myself have experience playing a couple of shorter D&D campaigns and helping GM/co-GM as well as homebrew systems but will be new to playing and GMing Pathfinder. It'll hopefully also go on longer than my previous campaigns. We'll all go through an adventure that's meant to introduce everyone into the system and rules, no matter if you're completely new or used to a different TTRPG system with completely different rules. Pathfinder 2e has roots in D&D but the system has a few significant differences. All the rules for Pathfinder are available online for free and officially sanctioned, which gives everyone a lot of choice. I can also share content from lore and rules books when and if wanted.

## Format, Frequency & Requirements

I would run the campaign online with one session (2-4h each session) once every 2 weeks, with the days left to be decided for now (Preferred options right now are Monday-Wednesday at some point after work, maybe into the night; or at some time during Saturday). For playing online we would use [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com) as the main tool and Discord for Voice communication during the game as well as text chats in-between sessions. This means that you'll need some way to communicate online in voice, FoundryVTT also heavily recommends a mouse as the touchscreen/touchpad experience is not great.

## Session 0

There will be a session 0 where we can go over character creation (feel free to already bring your finished character or concept in any stage along) and talk about how the group fits together or what connections there are between characters. We'll also talk about how we want the games to be and how it shouldn't be, or what shouldn't appear in game. I personally like a balance between roleplaying and combat, but the very start of the adventure will probably at first introduce the combat and exploration activities while social interactions with NPCs will be a bit after the basics of combat are done. We can also talk about lines and veils to make sure only content appears that everyone is okay with, or some other safety tools, either as part of session 0 or between the beginner adventure [[TTRPGs/Menace Under Otari\|Menace Under Otari]] and follow-up adventures, since the beginner adventure won't have any content that should be an issue.

### About Content Warnings

I'll always let you know about content warnings for the adventures I'm gonna run, so please let me know if there's and issue with any of it and I'll adjust it to make it okay for everyone to enjoy while keeping the adventure in mind. I'm also trying to make the content warnings very obvious (see the content warnings for [[TTRPGs/Menace Under Otari\|Menace Under Otari]] and [[TTRPGs/Abomination Vaults\|Abomination Vaults]]), but I'm still human, so please let me know if I let something slip.

## Adventure & Campaign Setting

Since I'm new to Pathfinder myself and don't have that much experience GMing either I want to start slowly with some official adventures and content. I'll still try to modify and adjust it here and there, but we won't go into a full on custom world. My plan is to start with the "Menace under Otari" adventure that's part of the Pathfinder Beginner Box and well thought out to introduce the system and mechanics to everyone. Then we can build on top of it with "Troubles in Otari" to further the story in Otari and the surrounding area a bit, or go to one of a few one-shots as options for some smaller adventures at different levels for people to try different classes and some shorter fun adventures, or go straight into the "Abomination Vaults" which is a full on adventure path from level 1-11 which we could continue further after. Some of the content comes with pre-generated characters to choose from if you don't want to build your own. They all have a backstory and art already.

So it would look something like this:

- [[TTRPGs/Menace Under Otari\|Menace Under Otari]] (Beginner Box, getting to know the system)
- Advancing with a few different choices:
    - [[TTRPGs/Troubles in Otari\|Troubles in Otari]] and advancing the story around Otari a bit further
    - Choice of a couple of one-shots for some short time funs and more flexibility trying different characters and scenarios, for example:
        - [[TTRPGs/Little Trouble in Big Absalom\|Little Trouble in Big Absalom]]
        - [[TTRPGs/A Fistful of Flowers\|A Fistful of Flowers]]
        - [[TTRPGs/Sundered Waves\|Sundered Waves]]
    - Start the [[TTRPGs/Abomination Vaults\|Abomination Vaults]] for a longer term adventure path
