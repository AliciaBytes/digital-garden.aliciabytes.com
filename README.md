# Digital Garden

This repository contains data for my digital garden. It will slowly be cultivated and grow with time.

## Acknowledgement

To make my digital garden work I use the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
